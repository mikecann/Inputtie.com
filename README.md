# Inputtie.com

This is a backup of a wordpress site I built many moons ago. 

I exported the site using Simply Static plugin then uploaded to Github and hosted on Netlify.

Massive thanks to all those guys.

I let the Inputtie.com domain lapse but this exported site is visible at: https://zealous-engelbart-de705e.netlify.com/
